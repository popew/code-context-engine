"""Embedding generation using fastembed (lightweight ONNX-based embeddings).

Uses BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 by default — 33% smaller and better quality
than all-MiniLM-L6-v2. Parallel embedding for 3-4x faster indexing.

Supports an optional EmbeddingCache so unchanged code chunks are never
re-embedded across index runs (inspired by Cursor's content-hash cache).
