"""Loopback HTTP server for Claude Code hook payloads.

Bound to 127.0.0.1 on a random free port. The port is written to
`<storage_base>/serve.port` so the hook shell script can find it without
configuration. No auth — the listener is loopback-only.

Started as a background asyncio task from `_run_serve` (the MCP server
process). Stopped gracefully on shutdown.
