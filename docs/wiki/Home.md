# Code Context Engine

Code Context Engine (CCE) is a local-first MCP server that gives Claude Code a persistent, searchable brain for your codebase. Instead of re-reading files every session, Claude queries an index — fetching only the chunks it actually needs.

## Why CCE Exists

Every Claude Code session starts cold. Claude has no memory of your project. The typical workaround is pasting files manually, which is expensive and repetitive.

| Without CCE | With CCE |
|-------------|----------|
| Paste 3-4 files every session to set context | Claude queries the index on demand |
| Claude re-reads the same code over and over | Each chunk is fetched once |
| Decisions made last week have to be re-explained | Architectural decisions persist across sessions |
| Large repos burn tokens just to orient Claude | Only relevant chunks are retrieved |
| Silent result truncation when context is full | Overflow items listed as expandable references |

**The token cost:**

```
Without CCE:  paste payments.py + shipping.py = 45,000 tokens
With CCE:     search "payment processing"      =    800 tokens
```

Over 30 queries in a typical project, that difference compounds into real API cost savings.

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

**Install:**
```bash
uv tool install code-context-engine
```

**Index your project:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
cce init
```

**Restart Claude Code.** Claude now has `context_search` and eight other MCP tools available automatically.

## What Claude Gets

Once CCE is connected, Claude has access to these tools without any setup:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `context_search` | Semantic search across your indexed codebase |
| `expand_chunk` | Get full source for a compressed or overflow chunk |
| `related_context` | Find related code via graph edges (calls, imports) |
| `session_recall` | Recall past decisions and code area notes |
| `record_decision` | Save a decision for future sessions |
| `record_code_area` | Record which files you worked in and why |
| `index_status` | Check when the index was last updated |
| `reindex` | Trigger re-indexing of a file or the full project |
| `set_output_compression` | Adjust response verbosity (off / lite / standard / max) |
